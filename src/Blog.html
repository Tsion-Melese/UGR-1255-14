                                Life is a journey, but let's not get lost in travel. Instead, you must focus on what is within you. The journey of life will change you and unlock what is inside of you. As you evolve during the journey, you have to be sure that all of the changes you are making are positive. Don't allow missteps in the journey be permanent.

                                    "What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you."
                                    <footer> - Ralph Waldo Emerson</footer>

                                 One's existence is emphasized through the act of thinking.The essence of the proposition lies in the recognition that the very act of doubt and thought confirms one's existence. By engaging in the process of thinking and doubt, an individual becomes aware of their own consciousness, and this self-awareness becomes the irrefutable evidence of their being. This philosophy has had a profound impact on the understanding of the self, consciousness, and the nature of reality, influencing not only philosophy but also various fields of inquiry.

                            <li> Change suggests an active and adaptive approach to life's inevitable transformations. Rather than resisting or fearing change, the quote encourages embracing it as a dynamic and natural part of the human experience. By likening change to a dance, it conveys the idea of flowing with the rhythm of life, responding to the music of transformation, and finding meaning in the ever-shifting patterns
                                </li><blockquote>
                                    "The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance."

                        <p>New Yorker writers Naomi Fry, Vinson Cunningham, and Alexandra Schwartz convene each week to talk about cultural phenomena, from Martin Scorsese's oeuvre to Taylor Swift's cultural dominance, and they've already found a pleasant rhythm. Unlike other podcasts that focus solely on a particular piece of art each episode, these critics begin with a deep read of a new release. </p>
