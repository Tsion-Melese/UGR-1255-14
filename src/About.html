                    I'm Tsion, a passionate software engineering student living in Ethiopia. I have a deep love for nature, and my favorite companion in this world is undoubtedly the dog. Back in my school days, I discovered a passion for mathematics, and it was this love for problem-solving that ultimately led me to pursue engineering. As I delved into the world of engineering, I found myself increasingly captivated by technology and coding, sparking a new and exciting chapter in my journey.

                <h2> What leads me to pursue personal growth?</h2>
                <article><p>As a spirited and determined female software engineering student, my adventure in the tech realm is a continuous journey of growth, peppered with the support and warmth of family and friends. In this dynamic field, my vision includes delving into exciting coding projects, pushing the boundaries of what I can create, and contributing to inventive solutions. Beyond the lines of code, I'm dedicated to cultivating not just technical skill but also the softer skills like effective communication, collaboration, and leadership.</p>
                <p> In future chapters of my journey, I see myself not only participating in hackathons and coding competitions but also sharing the highs and lows with my friends who share a passion for innovation. The late-night coding sessions might be accompanied by laughter, brainstorming, and a shared enthusiasm for the possibilities our projects hold.  Embracing challenges, seeking mentorship, and fostering a supportive network are integral parts of my hypothetical journey towards becoming a successful and joyfully empowered software engineer</p></article>

                    <p><strong><em>Michelle Obama</em></strong> - stands as a powerful inspiration and role model for me. Beyond her role as the former First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama is amazing for her unwavering commitment to education, health, and social issues. Her advocacy for accessible education, particularly for girls, has left an indelible mark on communities globally and me.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Hedy Lamarr</em></strong> - serves as a compelling role model for me as a software engineering student due to her remarkable blend of innovation, interdisciplinary skills, and perseverance. Beyond her iconic career in Hollywood, Lamarr's invention of frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology during World War II showcases her intellectual curiosity and the transformative potential of applying knowledge across diverse domains. As I navigate the challenges of software engineering, I find inspiration in Lamarr's resilience, facing skepticism about her technical contributions while challenging societal expectations.</p>
